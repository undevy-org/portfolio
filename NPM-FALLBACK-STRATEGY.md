# NPM Registry Fallback Strategy - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implemented NPM Registry Fallback Strategy designed to address intermittent CI/CD pipeline failures during dependency installation. The solution implements a phased approach starting with cache optimization and progressively adding fallback mechanisms as needed.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Cache-Optimized Installation (IMPLEMENTED)

**Objective**: Achieve 95% success rate with minimal latency (< 2 minutes)

**Key Features**:
- GitHub Actions npm cache using `actions/cache@v4`
- Cache key based on `package-lock.json` hash
- Offline-first installation with `--prefer-offline` flag
- Single attempt with 3-minute timeout
- Comprehensive performance metrics collection
- Emergency bypass mechanism

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Single Fallback Registry (READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION)

**Trigger**: If Phase 1 success rate < 90% after 1 week monitoring

**Features**:
- Alternative registry: `https://registry.yarnpkg.com/`
- Registry health check before switching
- Additional 45-second maximum delay

### ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Full Three-Level Strategy (READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION)

**Trigger**: If Phase 2 success rate < 97% after 1 week monitoring

**Features**:
- Comprehensive three-level fallback strategy
- Adaptive retry mechanisms
- Multiple registry options
- Advanced error classification

## Current Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow Changes

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

The previous aggressive 5-attempt retry mechanism has been replaced with:

```yaml
- name: Cache NPM dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-npm-

- name: Install dependencies with cache optimization
  env:
    EMERGENCY_NPM_BYPASS: ${{ vars.EMERGENCY_NPM_BYPASS }}
  run: |
    # Phase 1: Cache-optimized installation with single attempt
    npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund --timeout=180000
```

### NPM Configuration Updates

**File**: `.npmrc`

Key changes:
- `prefer-offline=true` - Prioritize cached packages
- `cache-min=86400` - Cache packages for 24 hours
- `fetch-retries=1` - Reduced retries (CI handles retry logic)
- `fetch-timeout=120000` - 2-minute timeout per attempt
- `maxsockets=10` - Optimized connection pooling

### Performance Metrics Collection

The implementation now collects detailed metrics:
- `npm_install_duration` - Installation time in seconds
- `npm_install_attempts` - Number of attempts (always 1 in Phase 1)
- `npm_cache_strategy` - Cache strategy used
- `npm_registry_used` - Registry that served dependencies
- `npm_failure_reason` - Detailed failure classification

## Emergency Bypass Mechanism

### Activation Methods

#### 1. Repository Variables (Recommended)
```bash
# In GitHub repository: Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Variables
# Add: EMERGENCY_NPM_BYPASS = true
```

#### 2. Workflow Environment Override
```yaml
env:
  EMERGENCY_NPM_BYPASS: true
```

### Bypass Behavior
When activated, the system:
- Skips all fallback logic
- Uses simple `npm ci --timeout=300000`
- Provides 5-minute timeout
- Logs emergency bypass activation

## Migration from Previous Implementation

### What Was Removed
- 5-attempt retry loop with exponential backoff (30, 60, 120, 240 seconds)
- Aggressive cache clearing on each failure
- `npm install` fallback after all `npm ci` attempts fail
- Up to 15-minute potential delay

### What Was Added
- GitHub Actions npm caching
- Cache-optimized single attempt
- Performance metrics collection
- Emergency bypass capability
- Detailed diagnostic logging

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before (Previous Implementation)
- **Average Time**: 5-15 minutes with retry mechanism
- **Success on First Attempt**: ~85%
- **Maximum Delay**: Up to 15 minutes
- **Cache Utilization**: None (always online)

### After (Phase 1 Implementation)
- **Expected Time**: < 2 minutes for 95% of builds
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80% for unchanged dependencies
- **Maximum Delay**: 3 minutes (single attempt)
- **Cache Utilization**: Aggressive offline-first strategy

## Monitoring and Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Criteria (Monitor for 1 week)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 80%
- **Average Installation Time**: < 2 minutes
- **Success Rate**: > 90%
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Improved workflow experience

### Metrics Collection
All metrics are logged to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` and can be analyzed via:
- GitHub Actions workflow run summaries
- Custom monitoring dashboards (future enhancement)
- Manual log analysis
- Automated monitoring script: `./scripts/monitor-npm-fallback.sh`

### Weekly Monitoring
Run the monitoring script to track Phase 1 performance:
```bash
./scripts/monitor-npm-fallback.sh
```

This script provides:
- Recent workflow success rate analysis
- Local npm performance testing
- Configuration validation
- Cache status reporting
- Phase decision recommendations

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Cache Miss on Every Build
**Symptoms**: Installation time consistently > 2 minutes
**Solution**: 
1. Check if `package-lock.json` is being modified
2. Verify cache key generation
3. Review GitHub Actions cache limits

#### Issue: Installation Fails Immediately
**Symptoms**: Phase 1 fails with network errors
**Solution**:
1. Activate emergency bypass: `EMERGENCY_NPM_BYPASS=true`
2. Check npm registry status: https://status.npmjs.org/
3. Review network connectivity in workflow logs

#### Issue: Specific Package Failures (e.g., zustand)
**Symptoms**: Installation succeeds but specific packages missing
**Solution**:
1. Check package override configuration in `package.json`
2. Verify package-lock.json integrity
3. Review dependency tree: `npm list zustand`

### Emergency Contact Information
- **Primary Contact**: Development team lead
- **Escalation**: Create issue using repository templates
- **Critical Issues**: Use emergency bypass and create immediate issue

## Future Enhancements (Phases 2-3)

### Phase 2: Single Fallback Registry

**When to Implement**: If Phase 1 metrics show < 90% success rate

**Implementation**: Add registry health check and fallback to Yarn registry:
```yaml
- name: Install with fallback registry
  if: steps.phase1.outcome == 'failure'
  run: |
    if curl -s --connect-timeout 10 https://registry.yarnpkg.com/ > /dev/null; then
      npm ci --registry=https://registry.yarnpkg.com/ --timeout=90000
    fi
```

### Phase 3: Full Three-Level Strategy

**When to Implement**: If Phase 2 metrics show < 97% success rate

**Features**:
- Multiple registry fallbacks
- Adaptive retry timing
- Advanced error classification
- Circuit breaker logic

## Rollback Procedure

### Quick Rollback (Emergency)
```bash
# Activate emergency bypass immediately
# Repository Settings â†’ Variables â†’ Add EMERGENCY_NPM_BYPASS = true
```

### Full Rollback (Planned)
1. Revert commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. Restore previous ci.yml configuration
3. Update .npmrc to previous settings
4. Remove NPM-FALLBACK-STRATEGY.md

### Previous Configuration Reference
The previous working configuration can be found at:
```bash
git show main~1:.github/workflows/ci.yml
git show main~1:.npmrc
```

## Testing and Validation

### Pre-Deployment Testing
1. **Local Testing**: Verify npm cache behavior locally
2. **Branch Testing**: Test on feature branch before merge
3. **Smoke Testing**: Validate basic installation functionality

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. **Week 1**: Daily metrics review
2. **Week 2-4**: Weekly performance analysis
3. **Month 1**: Comprehensive success rate evaluation

### Test Scenarios
- **Cache Hit**: Build with unchanged dependencies
- **Cache Miss**: Build with modified package-lock.json
- **Network Issues**: Simulated registry connectivity problems
- **Emergency Bypass**: Validate bypass mechanism functionality

## Conclusion

The Phase 1 implementation focuses on the most impactful improvement: aggressive caching to reduce dependency on npm registry availability. This approach should solve the majority of issues while providing a foundation for additional fallback mechanisms if needed.

The phased approach ensures we implement only the complexity required to meet our success criteria, avoiding over-engineering while maintaining the ability to enhance the system based on real-world performance data.
