# Demo Mode Logout Issue Fix - Changes Made

## Summary
This document outlines all the changes made to fix the issue where users were automatically logged back into demo mode after attempting to log out.

## Files Modified

### 1. src/app/context/SessionContext.js

**Changes:**
- Added `logoutInProgress` state to track logout status
- Modified `endSession` function to:
  - Set `logoutInProgress` to true before clearing session data
  - Clear URL parameters using `window.history.replaceState`
  - Navigate to Entry screen
  - Reset `logoutInProgress` flag after a 500ms delay

### 2. src/app/page.js

**Changes:**
- Added `logoutInProgress` from context to component props
- Added ref tracking (`lastProcessedCodeRef`, `hasProcessedInitialLoadRef`, `hasProcessedDemoModeRef`)
- Modified useEffect to read URL parameters directly from `window.location.search` for more accurate values
- Added early return logic when `logoutInProgress` is true to skip all authentication logic
- Added tracking for demo mode processing to prevent duplicate triggers
- Added logic to reset demo mode processing flag when demo parameter is not present

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Logout Progress Tracking
- Added `logoutInProgress` state in SessionContext to track when logout is active
- Set flag before clearing session data and reset after a delay
- Check this flag early in page.js useEffect to prevent authentication during logout

### 2. Direct URL Parameter Reading
- Read URL parameters directly from `window.location.search` instead of relying solely on `useSearchParams`
- This ensures we have the most up-to-date URL values during authentication checks

### 3. Demo Mode Processing Tracking
- Added `hasProcessedDemoModeRef` to track whether demo mode has been processed
- Prevents demo mode from being triggered multiple times during a session
- Reset tracking when demo parameter is no longer present

### 4. Early Return Pattern
- Implemented early return in useEffect when logout is in progress
- Prevents any authentication logic (including demo mode) from running during logout

## Verification
- All linting rules pass
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Implementation follows React best practices for state management

## Remaining Issue
Despite these changes, the issue persists: users are still automatically logged back into demo mode after attempting to log out. Further investigation is needed to identify the root cause of this persistent behavior.
