2. Follow established design patterns and constraints
3. Use design tokens for consistent visual language
4. Validate designs against accessibility standards

### For Developers
1. Use documented components from the design system
2. Follow theming patterns for consistent styling
3. Implement new components according to design system guidelines
4. Test component implementations against design specifications
