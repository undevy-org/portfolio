# Development Diffs

This section contains development changes, implementation diffs, and change summaries for the Interactive Terminal Portfolio project. These files document the evolution of the codebase and provide detailed information about specific implementations and improvements.

## Documents in this section

- **[Implementation Summary](./implementation-diff-summary.md)** - High-level summary of major implementation changes and their impact
- **[NPM Strategy Diffs](./npm-fallback-strategy-diffs.md)** - Comprehensive documentation of NPM fallback strategy changes
- **[Complete NPM Strategy Diff](./npm-fallback-strategy-complete.diff)** - Complete unified diff for NPM fallback implementation
- **[CI Workflow Changes](./ci-workflow-changes.diff)** - CI/CD workflow optimization changes
- **[NPM Configuration Changes](./npmrc-configuration-changes.diff)** - NPM configuration optimization changes

## What you'll find here

### Implementation Summaries
- High-level overviews of major changes and improvements
- Impact analysis and performance metrics
- Implementation decision rationale and trade-offs
- Executive summaries for stakeholders and maintainers

### Detailed Diffs
- Complete unified diffs for applying changes
- Focused diffs for specific file or feature changes
- Human-readable change documentation with context
- Code evolution tracking and version comparisons

### Change Categories
- NPM fallback strategy implementations and optimizations
- CI/CD workflow improvements and automation
- Performance optimizations and monitoring
- Feature implementations and enhancements

## How to Use These Diffs

### For Code Review
1. Start with [implementation summaries](./implementation-diff-summary.md) for overview
2. Review detailed diff documentation for specific changes
3. Examine individual `.diff` files for precise file-level changes
4. Cross-reference with [development history](../development/) for context

### For Applying Changes
```bash
# Apply complete NPM strategy changes
git apply npm-fallback-strategy-complete.diff

# Apply specific component changes
git apply ci-workflow-changes.diff
git apply npmrc-configuration-changes.diff
```

### For Understanding Evolution
- Review implementation summaries for impact analysis
- Compare changes with [development history](../development/DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md)
- Check performance improvements and metrics
- Understand architectural decisions and trade-offs
