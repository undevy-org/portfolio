## Implementation Workflow

### For Developers
1. Review the [NPM Fallback Strategy](./NPM-FALLBACK-STRATEGY.md) for architecture understanding
2. Follow the [Integration Guide](./INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md) for step-by-step implementation
3. Use phase-specific implementation guides for advanced features
4. Test fallback mechanisms according to provided validation procedures

### For DevOps Engineers
1. Configure registry fallback mechanisms
2. Set up monitoring and alerting for fallback scenarios
3. Implement caching strategies for performance optimization
4. Deploy and validate fallback configurations in production environments
