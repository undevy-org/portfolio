##  Current Development Focus [IN PROGRESS]

This section outlines the major initiatives that are currently under active development.

### Initiative 1: Testing Infrastructure & Code Quality
-   Goal: To build a comprehensive testing suite that ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and enables confident refactoring.
-   Current Status: A foundational testing architecture using Jest and React Testing Library is in place. Unit tests for all critical utility functions and component tests for core UI elements have been created.
-   Next Steps: Resolve known incompatibilities with Next.js 13+ code coverage reporting. Enable and complete integration tests for full user flows.

### Initiative 2: Enhanced User Experience & Navigation
-   Goal: To refine the user journey by creating more immersive interactive experiences and improving navigation clarity.
-   Current Status: A stable navigation system with hierarchical breadcrumbs and a temporal session trace is implemented. The `ProfileBoot` sequence and `TerminalImagePreview` component provide rich, animated user feedback.
-   Next Steps: Continue to optimize component rendering to eliminate any remaining UI flicker during navigation. Further refine the navigation control logic for edge cases.

## [Phase 7] - UI Architecture & Theming System Refactor [COMPLETED]

This was a foundational overhaul of the entire styling system, moving from a rigid two-theme setup to a highly scalable, multi-theme architecture. This refactoring eliminated critical hydration errors, improved performance, and dramatically simplified future UI development.

### Multi-Theme Architecture via CSS Variables
-   Architectural Shift: Migrated the entire color system from Tailwind's `dark:` variant to a modern, robust architecture based on CSS variables and a `data-theme` attribute on the root HTML element.
-   Expanded Palette: Introduced six new creative themes ("Amber", "BSOD", "Synthwave", "Operator", "Kyoto", and "Radar") in addition to the existing Dark and Light modes. The system now supports eight distinct themes.
-   Instant, Flicker-Free Switching: Implemented a theme management system (`ThemeManager.js` and `SessionContext.js`) that allows for instantaneous, client-side theme changes with zero page reloads or layout shifts.

### Semantic CSS Class Library
-   Centralized Styling: Created a comprehensive library of semantic, theme-agnostic utility classes in `globals.css` (e.g., `.text-primary`, `.border-secondary`, `.btn-command`).
-   Component Refactoring: Refactored all UI components (`Button`, `Accordion`, `Tabs`, `TerminalWindow`, etc.) to use this new semantic library, completely decoupling them from theme-specific logic. This resolved numerous React hydration errors caused by server/client HTML mismatches.

### System & Documentation Updates
-   Theme Persistence: Added functionality to save the user's selected theme to `localStorage`, ensuring their choice is remembered across sessions.
-   Updated Design System: Completely rewrote the `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` document to reflect the new architecture, providing a clear guide for developers on how to use and extend the theming system.

### Phase 6: Headless CMS & Analytics
-   [COMPLETED] Interactive Content Editing: Implemented a full suite of interactive commands (`/add_case`, `/edit_case`, `/delete_case`) allowing for complete case study management directly from Telegram. Developed a state management system for handling multi-step user conversations.
-   [COMPLETED] Version Control System: Created a robust versioning system for `content.json` with commands to view history (`/history`), restore backups (`/rollback`), and compare versions (`/diff`).
-   [COMPLETED] Core CMS Foundation: Built a secure backend API with automated backups and a `grammY`-based Telegram bot with restricted admin access.

### Phase 5: Content Implementation
-   [COMPLETED] All Screens Built: Developed all remaining content screens, including `Timeline`, `CaseDetail`, `SkillsGrid`, and `Contact`, creating a complete and functional portfolio experience.
-   [COMPLETED] Reusable UI Components: Created and styled core UI components like `Accordion` and `Tabs` to support dynamic content presentation.

### Phase 4: UI Foundation & State Management
-   [COMPLETED] Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture: Refactored the project into an SPA after authentication, enabling instant client-side navigation with hash-based routing.
-   [COMPLETED] Global State Management: Implemented a global `SessionContext` to manage theme, navigation, and all shared client-side state.

### Phase 1-3: Infrastructure & Automation
-   [COMPLETED] CI/CD Pipeline: Established a complete CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
-   [COMPLETED] Infrastructure Deployment: Deployed the full stack on a DigitalOcean Droplet, including the Next.js app (managed by PM2), a self-hosted Matomo analytics instance (in Docker), and Nginx as a reverse proxy with SSL.
-   [COMPLETED] Project Scaffolding: Initialized the Next.js project, implemented the core gated-access logic, and set up all foundational documentation.
